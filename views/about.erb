<h1>About Interactive 3D Programming</h1>

<p>This workgroup's mission is to come together to learn and fortify our collective knowledge of Javascript, OpenGl, Mathematics and Programming Techniques to enrich our website creation. By using the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs291" rel="external">course found on Udacity of the same name</a>, and the book <a href="http://www.reedbushey.com/85Webgl%20Up%20and%20Running.pdf" rel="external">WebGl Up and Running</a> (also, you can download all relevant code from this book from this <a href="https://github.com/tparisi/WebGLBook" rel="external">site</a>, but don't just copy and paste), we'll cover in a unified manner the basic principles of 3D computer graphics: meshes, transforms, cameras, materials, lighting, and animation, as well as the use of the 3d Graphics Api, Three.js.</p>

<p>By the end of our workgroup, members will know enough to make an animated 3D demo program that runs in a web browser, while also understanding the basic principles of how realistic computer images are generated.</p>

<p>We will also create a unified website to demo our work along the way. Specifically the site will be used to show each other different and interesting techniques we design along the way as well as a demo to our advisors of our work completion. Final awarding of credit will be decided by ITP faculty based on documentation on the web site.</p>

<h2>Course Overview:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		Lesson 1: Introduction
		Motivation and a trip down the graphics pipeline, laying out the fundamental processes<br>
		Assignment 1: Read the first chapter in WebGL Up and Running, above. Do the introduction example to WebGL and usage. Feel free and please look at what you have at the end and personalize it, with any parameters you might like, i.e. adding new colors, using new locations for the vertices of the triangle. Just play around with it. Upload what you create to the website by adding a page from your profile. Look above to download the relevant code from the examples in the book.
